# MiSTer-analogIO-DiY

The aim of this repository is to share boards that can be easily crafted at home (ex. Electric iron) for MiSTer FPGA enthusiasts. No SMD, Trying to use almost one layer...

Of course, you can order these boards from OSHPark or any other PCB printing company, but that is not the main purpose of this repository.
